## About

This repository contains completed labs for the Artificial Intelligence course at my university.
The labs are designed to cover various topics within artificial intelligence,
providing hands-on experience and practical understanding of AI algorithms and machine learning techniques.

## Labs Description
1. Linear Regression
  - Description: This lab focuses on implementing and understanding the basics of linear regression, a fundamental technique in machine learning for predicting continuous values.This file implements simple linear regression to predict MPG (miles per gallon) using weight as the independent variable. It starts by obtaining and inspecting the data, followed by splitting it into training and testing sets. The closed-form solution is then computed to find the parameters that minimize the prediction error, with Mean Squared Error (MSE) used as the error metric. Additionally, it standardizes the data and calculates theta using Batch Gradient Descent, providing further analysis of the error and plotting the regression line for both the original and standardized data.

2. Genetic Algorithm
  - Description: In this lab, we study genetic algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. Genetic algorithms are used to solve optimization and search problems. In my case, the genetic algorithm solved the knapsack  problem

3. Minimax and Alphabeta Algorithms
  - Description: This lab contains my implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe with artificial intelligence powered by two search algorithms: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning. Developed as part of my university lab project, this program demonstrates the application of these algorithms in creating a challenging opponent for the game.
